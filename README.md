# Easy-C-File

The "Easy-C-File" is a versatile and user-friendly library designed to simplify file handling operations in C programming. It provides a relatively high-level abstraction that shields developers from the complexity of lower-level file operations. This library streamlines common file-related tasks and offers a robust set of functions for file and directory management, making it easier for developers to interact with files, directories, and binary data.

### Key Features:

#### Directory Management: 
The library offers functions to create and delete directories with just a single function call. It abstracts the underlying system-specific details, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

#### File Handling: 
Developers can easily read, write, append data, and delete files using high-level functions, simplifying file I/O operations and minimizing the need to deal with low-level file access.

#### Binary File Support: 
The library extends support for binary files, allowing developers to read and write binary data with ease. It abstracts the intricacies of binary file I/O, making it accessible to a broader range of developers.

#### List Files in Directory: 
The library simplifies the task of listing files in a directory. Developers can quickly obtain a list of filenames within a specified directory, simplifying tasks like file enumeration and processing.
